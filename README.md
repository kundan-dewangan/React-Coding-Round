future.
2. Componentization &amp; its combination.

Points to remember
1. No need to spend much time on UI - we are expecting minimum standards - we want - you
know CSS &amp; HTML
2. Bootstrap already installed - so if need, can use the bootstrap classes
3. Code quality is what we are looking for.
4. If any libraries will make your work more easy - You can install

i. for ex,
1. You can install any other UI framework that you more comfortable
with – like – instead Bootstrap can use material UI
2. The question involves showing list of employees - no need to use
any table libraries instead go with HTML table.

and start.

ii. npm install
iii. npm start - will run the project in local host port – 3000
